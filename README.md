### Hi there 👋

👩🏻‍💼 I'm Claudia. I work as a full-time product manager.

I plan and oversee projects from the initial ideation through to completion. To accomplish this, I devise solutions to genuine pains, encourage team members to seek results and quickly adapt to new insights. I have enjoyed endeavours in diverse industries throughout my career in project management, sales representative, content writer and recruiter.
