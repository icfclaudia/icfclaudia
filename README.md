### Hi there 👋

👩🏻‍💼 I'm Claudia. I'm a Product Manager [@Bloomidea](https://bloomidea.com).

I plan and oversee projects from the initial ideation through to completion. To accomplish this, I devise solutions to genuine pains, encourage team members to seek results and quickly adapt to new insights. I have enjoyed endeavours in diverse industries throughout my career in project management, sales representative, content writer and recruiter.

#### My personal and professional experiences have taught me the following about myself:
**I can successfully turn concepts into +40 functional applications.**
- I put the user at the centre of all I do
- I excel at predicting and removing roadblocks
- I strive to optimize processes

**I can align, lead and evolve 3 to 8-members product teams into delivering superb results.**
- I love to win, but helping the team win gives me greater joy
- I speak tech and exec
- I convert a teammates frustration into motivation
- The buck always stops with me

**I constantly educate and push myself to be better.**
- I continuously learn about a vast range of topics
- I do not repeat a mistake
- I observe and learn from coworkers

I enjoy reading, hiking and a good challenge. Get in touch if you want to talk to me about one of them.
